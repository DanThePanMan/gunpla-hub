- finish the post get and post routes, then do params for when you want a specific users' posts. 
-show all posts(route done, now i need to make it fetch on themain page")(done)

-pics (done)
    here is how pics will work: each pic has a url, and that can be stored in the db for image access

    in the app, after you upload, you retrieve the url and push it into postgres.

    1: start from the front end, make image uploadable and print out the image url
    2: make the post request also include images
    3: in the back end store it


-post detail (done)
    1. add post to react router
    1.5. make all posts clickable ot navigate to that link
    2. test out parameterized inputs
    3. write route for individual post content and make sure it actually gets the right post
    4. implement all post funcitonalities including share


                this is a maybe                      rewrite front end with new react project
                                        to do so, delete all the components except for jwt context and start form there
